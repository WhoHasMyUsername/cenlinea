Thanks for downloading my font!!
It's my first one, but I made sure that even though I'm a rookie when it comes to this, high quality is still assured. (There's even international characters included:)

"Montgomery" is based off of the opening credits of the classic TV show, "Bewitched". Not the cursive writing (which is available at Mischa Hof's Bewitched Web Site,  http://mischahof.com/bewitched/ ), but the font that lists the stars ("Starring Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York [or Sargent], Agnes Moorehead"...)

Since the credits were done by hand, a few discrepancies are inevitable. But I did the best I could to come up with a letter that resembled both. For example, the "D" used in York's credit is slightly smaller than the "D" in Sargent's, so the "D" in this font is somewhere between the two.

If you'd like the lettering to be exactly as it was in the opening credits, type normally ("Montgomery"). No kerning was done to the uppercase letters, so if you'd prefer the letters farther apart, type in capitals ("MONTGOMERY"). Type in lowercase ("montgomery") for the most condensed version. Or mix and match ("mOnTgomeRy") for the desired look. If nothing looks right (and that doesn't include your spellchecker underlining the funky use of letter cases), try typing spaces, or use Manual Kerning (different for each word processor).
